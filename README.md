# CodeClash

CodeClash is an interactive coding quiz that uses CodeMirror and MySQL to give a user a problem, take the user's input and run a series of test cases to determine the validity of the solution. By storing the test arguments and expected values rather than attempting to match input exactly we are able to check for a number of possible answers. CodeClash uses npm pacakges sequelize, express, mysql2, bcrypt, passport, body-parser, and method-orverride.
